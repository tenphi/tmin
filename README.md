===

Easy DOM content generator

inspired by [laconic.js](https://github.com/joestelmach/laconic) and client-side template engine by [ivan4th](https://github.com/ivan4th)

## Install

by bower

```bash
bower install tmin
```

## Usage

Fast and clean elements creation

```javascript
el = t.div({
  class: ['class1', 'class2']
},
  t.a({
      style: {
        color: 'red'
      },
      href: 'example.com'
  }, 'link')
);

console.log(el.outerHTML);
```

output:

```html
<div class="class1 class2"><a href="example.com" style="color: red;">link</a></div>
```

Easy creation of collections for instant appending

```javascript
element = t(
    t.div({ class: 'class1' }),
    t.div({ class: 'class2' })
);
```

Short usage (if needed)

```javascript
t(t.div, t.span);
```

Data attribute

```javascript
el = t.div({
    class: 'user',
    data: {
        name: 'Andrey',
        homeAddress: 'Moscow'
    }
});

console.log(el.outerHTML);
```

output:

```html
<div class="user" data-name="Andrey" data-home-address="Moscow"></div>
```

jQuery version

```javascript
$el = $t.div({
  class: ['class1', 'class2']
},
  $t.a({
      style: {
        color: 'red'
      },
      href: 'example.com'
  }, 'link')
);
```
